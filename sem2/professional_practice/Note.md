## Personal SWOT Analysis
Making the Most of Your Talents and Opportunities.
### Strengths
- What advantages do you have that others don't have (for example, skills, certifications, education, or connections)?
- What do you do better than anyone else?
- What personal resources can you access?
- What do other people see as your strengths?
- Which of your achievements are you most proud of?
- What values do you believe in that others fail to exhibit?
- Are you part of a network that no one else is involved in? If so, what connections do you have with influential people?
- Consider this from your own perspective, and from the point of view of the people around you. And don't be modest or shy - be as objective as you can.
### Weaknesses
- What tasks do you usually avoid because you don't feel confident doing them?
- What will the people around you see as your weaknesses?
- Are you completely confident in your education and skills training? If not, where are you weakest? What are your negative work habits (for example, are you often late, are you disorganized, do you have a short temper, or are you poor at handling stress?
- Do you have personality traits that hold you back in your field? For instance, if you have to conduct meetings on a regular basis, a fear of public speaking would be a major weakness.
- Again, consider this from a personal/internal T perspective and an external perspective. Do other people see weaknesses that you don't see? Do co-workers consistently outperform you in key areas? Be realistic-it's best to face any unpleasant truths as soon as possible.
### Opportunities
- What industries are you interested in? What do you know about it?
- Do you have a network to hel you, or offer good advice? What trends (management or otherwise) do you see in your field, and how can you take advantage of them?
- Is there a need in your company or industry that no one is filling?
- Do your customers complain about something in your company? If so, could you create an opportunity by offering a solution?
- Do you have specific skills (like a second language) that could help your career? Could you develop this further?
