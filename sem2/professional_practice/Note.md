## Personal SWOT Analysis
Making the Most of Your Talents and Opportunities.
### Strengths
- What advantages do you have that others don't have (for example, skills, certifications, education, or connections)?
- What do you do better than anyone else?
- What personal resources can you access?
- What do other people see as your strengths?
- Which of your achievements are you most proud of?
- What values do you believe in that others fail to exhibit?
- Are you part of a network that no one else is involved in? If so, what connections do you have with influential people?
- Consider this from your own perspective, and from the point of view of the people around you. And don't be modest or shy - be as objective as you can.
### Weaknesses
- What tasks do you usually avoid because you don't feel confident doing them?
- What will the people around you see as your weaknesses?
- Are you completely confident in your education and skills training? If not, where are you weakest? What are your negative work habits (for example, are you often late, are you disorganized, do you have a short temper, or are you poor at handling stress?
- Do you have personality traits that hold you back in your field? For instance, if you have to conduct meetings on a regular basis, a fear of public speaking would be a major weakness.
- Again, consider this from a personal/internal T perspective and an external perspective. Do other people see weaknesses that you don't see? Do co-workers consistently outperform you in key areas? Be realistic-it's best to face any unpleasant truths as soon as possible.
### Opportunities
- What industries are you interested in? What do you know about it?
- Do you have a network to hel you, or offer good advice? What trends (management or otherwise) do you see in your field, and how can you take advantage of them?
- Is there a need in your company or industry that no one is filling?
- Do your customers complain about something in your company? If so, could you create an opportunity by offering a solution?
- Do you have specific skills (like a second language) that could help your career? Could you develop this further?

### Threats
- What obstacles do you currently face at work or in your planned career?
- Does changing technology threaten your career?
- Are any of your colleagues competing with you for projects or roles?
- Is your job (or the demand for the things you do) changing? Does changing technology I threaten your position?
- Could any of your weaknesses lead to threats?
- Performing this analysis will often provide key information - it can point out what needs to be done and put problems into perspective.

   - One main idea per paragraph
   - Develop the 'argument" (theme)
- Check referencing and reference list
  - Be careful of plagiarising

### Linking/transition words and phrases
- Linking/transition words and phrases help you to connect ideas and sentences in writing your research. Such words bring clarity to your writing when you are introducing a contrasting point, add emphasis or agreement, and show a result or conclusion. Examples,
- Effect/consequence/result-regarding, consequently, as a result, according to, therefore.
- Emphasis- moreover, more evidently, additionally, in fact, indeed.
- Example-for instance, for example.
- Agreement-likewise, similarly
- Counterpoint/disagreement on the other hand, nevertheless, despite, although, however
- Sequence/order-first, second, third, next,finally
- Give reason-due to, due to the fact, owing to, owing to the fact, since, because.
- Conclusion/summary-in conclusion, to conclude, in a nutshell, in summary, to sum up, in short, in brief, in essence

### Author prominent citations
- Focus is given to the author name/s and is included as part of the sentence. It draws attention to the author /s in presenting findings in various studies

### Information prominent citations
- Priority is given to the information and author name/s are placed at the end of the sentence. This would be suitable in introducing a research area and in reviewing literature drawing from several studies.

### Paraphrasing and direct quoting
- Paraphrasing is where you take an idea from another source and express it in your own words without altering the original meaning while acknowledging the source.
- Direct quoting is when you take a word, phrase, sentence, or even a paragraph from another source as it is and incorporate it in to your writing while acknowledging source.

### Referencing: the Harvard system (Compulsory for UoG students - except for the SFM report)

#### Main reasons for referencing
- To acknowledge the person whose idea or words have been used, or referred to
- To make it clear that the author is not trying to pretend somebody else's work as his or her own ('plagiarising' someone else's work)
- To help readers to find the original texts or web pages to read themselves (in full)
#### What do we need to reference?
- The source of a particular theory, argument or viewpoint
- For specific information, such as statistics, examples, or case studies
- For direct quotations (reproducing the writer's exact words) - these must appear in 'quotation marks
- For texts and electronic information which is paraphrased rather than quoted
#### How do we reference?
- ALL sources MUST be attributed to the original author
   - Such as: ideas, data, figures, cables & methods
- UoG Business School rule: Only the Harvard referencing system must be used
   - Basic pattern: Author, (Date), Tule, Publisher or weburte
- If we do not reference, we would be accused of plagiarism -the most serious academic offence
   - If someone plagiarism they go before a plagiarism panel
   - The penalties can be heavy
#### Using sources
- Sources of data, ideas and theories are the basis of evidence and can be used in a variety of ways
   - "Quote" - using the exact words of an author
   - Paraphrase - using your own words to express an author's ideas
   - Summarise - listing the key ideas from an author's work
   - Comment - giving your own thoughts on what an author has written

#### The information needed for referencing a text
- The name and initials of the author(s)
- The title, in full
- The year of publication
- The edition
- The location of the publisher
- The name of publisher
- Relevant page numbers
- For journal articles - the name of the journal and the number of the volume
- For electronic materials - the webpage address and date accessed

#### Types of references
1. In-text references (author, date)
   - Placed within the main body of your writing
2. Secondary references
   - Used where one author has quoted another author
3. List of References
   - Full details of all sources listed at the end
4. Bibliography
   - Books and other sources which are relevant but have not been referred to directly (not used much in undergraduate work)

![[IMG20250604095216.jpg]]

#### In-text references ('citations')
- A. Quotations
  If you quote the actual words of a book, use quotation marks around the quote and at the end write:
  author's surname -year of publication - page number (in brackets)
- **Examples**:
  "The matching, or accruals convention is very important in the calculation of profit" (Gowthorpe, 2005, p152)
  or...
  "The matching, or accruals convention is very important in the calculation of profit" (Gowthorpe, 2005:152)

- B. Paraphrasing
  When writing in your own words rather than quoting: author-date (usually no page number)
- Examples
  When referring to the author in the sentence -bAccording to Gowthorpe (2005) the accrual principle is vital for proper calculation of profit
  or...
  When not referring to the author in the sentence - The proper estimation of profit requires implementation of the accrual principle (Gowthorpe, 2005).
#### Secondary references
- Authors cited by other authors
   - You may sometimes need to use a quotation or an idea from an author which you found quoted in a text book written by another author.
   - Show the reference in this way using the word "cited"
- Example:
  Bryjne highlights that an international set of accounting standards needs to be consistent between competing companies (Bryjne, 1980 cited by Iqbal 2002 p222)
- However some alternative ways are acceptable
#### Electronic sources
- WEB SITE: http://mobile.vnunet.com
- Over 80% wanted to see common management information systems to support IFRS detail including budgets and forecasts while 69% said there was a need for greater contextual information in annual reports
  - 1995-2006 all rights reserved VNU Business Publications
- How would you reference a quotation from this web site?

#### In-text references - websites
- Websites are treated the same as book references
- Use (Author, date)
- Do not give the www address in the text
- The internet is just another publishing medium and does not need special rules
- If you cannot find an author name, give the company or institution name of the site
- If there is no date of publication, give the year accessed

- Using the VNU data given, in-text citation would be -
   - "Over 80% wanted to see common management information systems to support IFRS detail including budgets and forecasts while 69% said there was a need for greater contextual information in annual reports"
    (VNU Business Publications, 2005)
- The full html address will appear at the end of your assignment in the list of references (later slide)

![[IMG20250604101135.jpg]]


#### The list of references ('References')
At the end of your work collect your references together in a list - 'References'
- Always include this at the end of your work (before appendices) 
   - Although the 'References' section is not a chapter
- Include all of your in-text references
- Only list each source once
- Use alphabetical (A-Z) order by author's family name
- Make one list - do not separate books, articles and websites
- Do not number the entries

#### References - Books (texts)
- You will lose marks if you leave out some of your in-text references
- You will lose marks if you put sources in the list you haven't referred to
- The following format must be adopted:

### What is the module about?

#### Social Issues?
- Information systems and computer technologies are used in society, for society, and by society.
- Their social impact is widespread and profound
- E.g...impact on work, communication, entertainment, medicine/health, transport, warfare
- Implications for individuals, communities, societies?
- What are the positive and negative aspects?
- What are the benefits and gains?
- What are the risks and losses?
#### Ethical Issues?
- If information systems bring social benefits, how do we decide what is "beneficial" and what is not?
- How do IT professionals decide what is "the right thing" to do?
- The design, the management and the use of information systems raise ethical issues...for IT professionals, managers, and the public
- How do we identify and assess these issues?
- What ethical principles might be involved?

#### Professional Issues?
- As future IT professionals, you will be working with information systems in various capacities
- Understanding the implications of decisions, choices, actions, policies
- Justifying decisions, actions, behaviour
- What does it mean to be a "professional"?:-
   - Adhering to professional codes of conduct?
   - Behaving "ethically"? Doing the "right thing"?

#### Legal Issues?
- Behaving professionally also means:-
   - Knowing the relevant legislation
   - Complying with the Law in your professional practice
- This module will help you to:
   - Understand legal issues
   - Understand the relationship between the "Law", "Ethics" and "Professionalism" (these are not always in harmony with each other)

### Why? Rationale
Relevance of this module to you:
- Informing tomorrow's IT professionals
- Raising awareness of your role as a future IT professional
- Exploring issues you may well face in your careers
- Ensuring the best use of technologies (ethical and socially responsible)
- IT graduates need to be aware of these issues (British Computer Society)

![[IMG20250606092542.jpg]]


###### Activity 2:
Get into groups of 3 or 4. Each group will be assigned one of the following fields of application, and should think about the social impact of ICT in that field:-
- Higher Education
- Law Enforcement
- Communication
- Banking/Finance
- News Media
- Health/Medicine
- Warfare
- The Home
Within your assigned field, think of examples of how computer technologies have had "positive" and "negative" effects (or "advantages" and "disadvantages"). As a group, try to come up with at least with 2 positive and 2 negative effects. What underlying issu issues and questions are raised?

### What is "Ethics"?
- Most people have some idea of what is "ethical" and what is "unethical"....But what do these terms mean?
- Ethics is a discipline concerned with:
   - Moral duty and obligation
   - Principles of conduct governing human behaviour
   - Rules determining notions of "right" and "wrong"
- "Ethics" are not the same as personal opinions or tastes
- "Ethics" are founded on sound reasoning and rational principles

### Ethical principles
- Behaviour is informed by ethical principles
	- "if you do X you are good ..."
	- "if you do Y you are bad..."
- What principles underlie behaviour X and behaviour Y?
- Principles of 'good' behaviour (X) might include:-
	- Respecting others
	- Considering others as equal; Treating people fairly
	- Keeping your word; Acting honestly
	- Respecting others' property
- Principles of 'bad' behaviour (Y)?...opposite of above?

### Social Norms & Cultural Values
- Social norms and cultural values also shape our ethical principles, and provide us with guidance
- These are determined by the societies and communities in which we live, our religion, family upbringing, social class, age, peer groups, media, etc.
- Ethical principles may therefore vary between societies and cultures, and within them
- Are their universal ethical principles that most people would agree with?

### Universal principles
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights (United Nations)
	- adopted by General Assembly of the UN [1948]
- Formal expression of what many people believe to be 'right'
- Ethical principles enshrined in the UDHR include:
	- "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights....Recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world."

### Universal principles
Ethical principles enshrined in the UDHR (cont'd):
- Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth:
	- Life, liberty and security of person
	- Privacy, honour and reputation
	- To own property (and not be deprived of their property)
	- Freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion and expression

### Ethical Theories
- Ethical theories attempt to explain why we think some actions are "good" and others "bad"
- Tools for assessing issues and making decisions
- Commonly used theories from the European philosophical tradition include:
	- Deontological theories
	- Consequentialist theories

### Deontological theories
- Concerned with moral duty ("deon" = duty)
- Associated with Immanuel Kant
- Actions are right or wrong in themselves, regardless of consequences
	- Eg. killing, lying, cheating
- There are no circumstances where such actions are ethically justify
- Principles of universality, rationality
- Problems with this approach?

### Consequentialist theories
- Actions are right or wrong depending on their consequences
- Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, in which "good" actions are those which bring the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people
- Problems with this approach?

### Applying Ethical Theories
- Ethical theories can be used to examine different arguments and possible courses of action
- Example: "unauthorised access" to computer systems
	- What if someone hacked into a computer network in order to expose information that was in the public interest?
- What would be the deontological position on this?
- How about a consequentialist or utilitarian position?

### Computer Ethics
The 10 commandments of computer ethics:
1. Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.
2. Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work.
3. Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.
4. Thou shalt not use a computer to steal.
5. Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness.
6. Thou shalt not copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid.
7. Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization or proper compensation.
8. Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output.
9. Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing.
10. Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for your fellow humans.

### Identifying Ethical Issues
- Ethical issues arise when ethical principles are threatened
- E.g. Ethical principle: "respect other people's property"
	- Action: "accessing someone's computer system without their permission" (e.g. hacking, using spyware, etc.)
- Some other key ethical principles:
	- Right to privacy; right to freedom of expression
	- Right of access to information (right to know)
	- Fairness, justice, equality
	- Honesty, integrity, openness, transparency
	- Confidentiality, trust, consent
	- Others?
- Ethical issues are often contentious areas or dilemmas in which....
	- The issues are not simply black or white
	- There are "grey" areas
	- There are no clear "right" or "wrong" answers
	- There are opposing perspectives and points of view
	- There are different approaches leading to different courses of action
- Ethical issues are often framed as questions...
	- Should a law firm be able to access data about the online activities of broadband customers if those customers are suspected of illegally downloading copyrighted material?

### Evaluating ethical issues
- Evaluating an ethical issue requires:
	- Identifying the issue or question
	- Who is affected? (stakeholders)
	- What is at stake? What ethical principles are involved?
	- Different perspectives and arguments
	- Possible courses of action, outcomes and solutions
- Importance of thinking through the issue and examining the options, rather than "following the crowd"
- Importance of making decisions based on principles and sound reasons

### The Law
Professionals are expected to comply with the Law
- Identifying and assessing legal issues requires some knowledge of the relevant legislation. For example:-
	- laws governing computer misuse, intellectual property, data protection, etc
For example, the Computer Misuse Act (UK) covers:
- Unauthorised access to computer material
- Unauthorised access with intent to commit further offences
- Unauthorised modification of computer material
Computing technologies and information systems must be designed to comply with the law
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents


### Ethics and the Law
What is the relationship between ethics and the law? Are they the same?
- Ethical principles inform the law in many cases
	- E.g. Laws against killing, stealing property, slander and libel (attacking someone's reputation) etc.
- Laws are similar to ethical principles but presented in a formal way, carrying sanctions
- But are laws always ethical?
- Laws may be ethical or unethical

### Ethics and the Law
4 possible relationships between Ethics and Law - actions/policies can be:
- Ethical and Legal
- Ethical but Illegal
- Unethical but Legal
- Unethical and Illegal
Examples
- While the Law is a good starting point, ethics goes beyond the Law. Acting within the law is the minimum
- If there is no Law governing an action, this doesn't mean that the action is ethically acceptable (as in "it's not illegal, so it must be OK")

### Professional Codes of Conduct
Professional IT organisations provide guidelines and codes of conduct for their members and for the profession as a whole
- British Computer Society and The Institution of Engineering and Technology are examples in the UK
- IFIP Member Countries: http://www.ifip.org/
- BCS code of conduct covers areas such as:
	- Public interest; Duty to employers and clients
	- Duty to profession; Professional competence and integrity

### Codes of Conduct, law and ethics
- There is no legal requirement to belong to a professional IT body in order to practice in the UK
- But...IT professionals are required to have knowledge and understanding of the law, and to comply with it
- Codes of conduct are informed by ethical principles
- All IT professionals, if members of a professional body, are required to comply with a code of ethics - that is, to act ethically
- Issues of accountability and moral responsibility

### Professional Issues: Technology Development
Technologies are developed for various reasons (including social, economic, political & military)
- IT professionals play a key role in technology development
- The decisions they make involve ethical choices
	- Decisions about what to develop, and how to design it
	- Decisions about user requirements, functions, etc
	- Judgements about what is "important", and what is not
- What problems should technologies solve?
- What social needs should they meet?

### Professional issues
- What professional issues might be involved in:
	- Designing a new computer game?
	- Implementing a surveillance system in a secondary school?
	- Developing software for unmanned military vehicles?
	- Creating a new database of patient records for the health service?
	- Designing a secure website for anonymous whistle-blowers
- What social impacts might an information systems professional need to consider?
- What will be the impact on society of the system?
- Examples:
	- Impact on work-life balance (always available?)
	- Impact of games and other entertainment?
	- Ability to share information on a social network?
	- Using information systems to maintain and share health records?
	- Capability of individuals and groups to communicate by mobile phone?
	- Capability to broadcast/publish opinion and comments, broadcast and publish photos and videos?

### Social and ethical issues raised
- Example: GPS (global positioning systems)
- Why developed?
- Uses: mapping, navigation (e.g. SatNav), satellite surveillance, military target selection, military reconnaissance, espionage
- Social issues: location monitoring and surveillance-by whom? of whom? for what purposes? The ubiquity and invisibility of surveillance. Are we safer, as a result?
- How might these technologies be used or abused?
- Ethical issues raised: privacy, transparency, openness, trust, security

### Technology: Dual Use Dilemmas
- Many technologies can be used for benefit or harm
	- Being able to locate elderly or confused people who get lost seems a 'benefit'
	- Being able to locate children who get lost or taken - seems a 'benefit'
- Therefore, should the elderly and / or children be tagged? (RFID devices)
- Social networks - good to keep in touch (or be bullied? Or looked at by employers/governments?)
- What other ways could today's technologies be used beneficially, or harmfully?

#### Lineup today...
- What we mean by "privacy"?
- Why is it important?
- Implications of ICT for privacy
- Personal information and privacy
- Social and ethical issues raised

You may want to watch "Why Privacy Matters" - just over 15 minutes long - follow link available from http://www.snowdentreaty.org/(scroll down the web page)

#### What is "Privacy"?
- Privacy can mean many different things - such as?
- Privacy is an essential element of freedom & autonomy why do you think that is?
### Aspects of Privacy
- Privacy can be about:
	- Confidentiality (limiting the spread of information about yourself)
	- Anonymity (being free from unwanted attention)
	- Solitude (lack of proximity to others)
- If "knowledge is power" then...
	- ....the more other people know about us..
	- the more power they have...and the less power we have
	- Lack of privacy changes behaviour - meaning less 'free' and less autonomous (able to act independently without coercion)
### Types of "Privacy"
- What aspects of ourselves, our lives (social and work) do we want to be private?

#### Categories of Privacy
1. Bodily Privacy
2. Territorial Privacy
3. Communications Privacy
4. Information Privacy

- ICT has implications for all 4 categories
- We will focus on 4. Information Privacy
- At issue is the control of personal information-who we choose to give it to, and what they do with it?

#### Who says Privacy is important?
- The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
  Article 12 states "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks". [http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml]

- The European Convention on Human Rights
  Article 8 ensures that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and correspondence.

- The Human Rights Act, 1998 (UK)
  Article 8 upholds the right to privacy.

#### Implications of ICT for privacy
- Why/ how has ICT made a difference?
- Capacity to collect, store, manipulate, share, interpret and publish personal information.....on a scale and in ways beyond anything we have known
- Invisible collection of data - personal data, relationship data (friends/contacts), communication data (who we communicate with and how often), location data, hobbies/interests, food preferences, etc.

Implications of ICT for privacy
- Data mining
- Data sharing, matching and profiling
- Secondary use of personal information
- Organisations holding our personal data?
- E.g. Government departments, public records, supermarkets, healthcare providers, banks, police, insurance companies, marketing and credit-checking companies (Experian, Acxiom) and others.
- Dataveillance (Data+Surveillance)
- Data trails and digital footprints
- Data retention of online activity (e.g. by ISPs)
- Search engines (e.g. Google)
	- Logging search queries, pages visited, etc
- Surveillance and monitoring technologies
	- CCTV, ANPR, scanning of emails, body scanning
	- E.g. workplace monitoring of employee emails, browsing, computer activity, etc
- Location tracking technologies
	- GPS (Global Positioning System)
	- RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)

### Data collection: the benefits
- Some data collection is necessary to provide government and commercial services. E.g:-
	- Driving licences, car tax, etc.
	- Social services: data-sharing, protecting children
	- Health service (electronic patient records)
- Free services in exchange for personal information (discounts from loyalty cards, ads from free email)
- Workplace monitoring is necessary to prevent time-wasting, and provide legal protection for companies
- Logging of search queries means improved results
- Protecting citizens and providing security
- Law enforcement (crime prevention and detection)
- National security, counter-terrorism
	- Information technologies enable intelligence to be provided to government and police to meet their responsibilities to protect citizens
- These benefits justify the loss of some privacies
- "If you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to fear!"

### Data collection: the risks
- Who has access to personal data? How is it used?
- Lack of public confidence in ability to protect personal data (against theft, loss, leaks)
- Potential for misuse of personal data (E.g. health data)
- Rights of organisations to hold personal information, or sell it to others without our knowledge or consent
- Workplace monitoring can be seen as intrusive, invasive
- How effective is surveillance and monitoring in maintaining a) law and order b) national security?
- Concerns that profiling of citizens gives governments too much power (fears of a Big Brother society)
- "If you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear"??
- A desire for privacy does not imply wrong doing
- Fears of prosecution, or persecution, of innocent people.
- Privacy concerns about RFID and GPS (detailed information about past movements and current location)


### Ethical issues
Argument: privacy supports 'free' behaviour, freedom of thought, freedom to live life according to own personal principles... that is to have personal autonomy.
```
Personal autonomy is a fundamental ethical principle-without autonomy how could any individual make any choice? (ethical or otherwise)
```
Technologies with the capacity to track/monitor behaviour
- Image or video recording technologies - CCTV, cameras fitted to cars (e.g. Google street cars, or cars that record illegal parking (e.g. London), or drones)
- Tagging e.g. by radio frequency identification tags (RFID) example: in UK some criminals tagged rather than being in prison;
- Smart card 'tagging': children in US given RFID badges (ID cards) to be tracked at school (see: epic.org); tags used to track animals;
- Embedded tags (RFID): animals, humans (see e.g. Baja Beach Club, Barcelona - instead of cash for drinks*)
	Ethical issues? data collection and usage, surveillance, privacy issues, Legal issues?
- How to balance the needs for a) public security and b) personal privacy
- How much privacy are we willing to give up for "free" services, convenience and security?
- Issues of personal responsibility/awareness
	- People willingly disclose information about themselves on the Internet
- Obligations of organisations and IT professionals
- Can there be "privacy" when so much personal data is publicly accessible/searchable?

## Social Media: Context

- "Social Media" includes:-
	- SNS, blogs, Twitter, wikis, content-sharing (video, music), virtual worlds, P2P
- Web 2.0:-
	- Database-driven, searchable websites
	- Web-based applications ("cloud" models)
	- 3rd party apps / platforms (many = open source)
	- User-generated content, authoring capabilities
	- Iterative content
	- Real-time interactivity
	- Web feed, syndication of content (e.g. via RSS)

SNS: Forerunners
- Networked computers for social communication is nothing new
- Early Internet applications ("people to people"):
	- Usenet, Listserv, bulletin boards, electronic information exchange, multi-user systems, groupware, email, etc
- Forerunners of SNS:
	- Geocities (1994), Classmates.com (1995), SixDegrees.com (1997), Friends Reunited (1999), Friendster (2002), MySpace (2003), Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005)
### Latest figures
See live statistics at: http://www.internetlivestats.com/

Pew Research (US)
- More broadly, the steady growth in adoption that social platforms have experienced in the United States over the past decade also appears to be slowing.
- The shares of adults who say they use Facebook, Pinterest, Linkedin and Twitter are each largely the same as in 2016, with only Instagram showing an uptick in use during this time period. (There are no comparable 2016 phone survey data for YouTube, Snapchat, WhatsApp or Reddit.)
https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/
### Who is interested in figures
Marketing organisations - "93% of marketers use social media for business."
According to their statistics:
- "The fastest growing segment of social media users is now adults aged 45-54% (sic). 55% of this age group now have a profile on at least one social network"
https://www.omnicoreagency.com/digital-marketing-statistics/
### SNS: Features
- The "profile" (self-description) + timeline
- Public listing of "friends" (social graph)
- Friend approval and confirmation tools
- Communication tools (messaging, etc)
- Privacy and visibility controls
- User-generated content & add-on applications
- "Networked communication infrastructure" [Castells, 2008, Communication Power]
- Walled Gardens
### SNS: Business Model
- Relationship between SNS and advertising?
- Niche marketing (targetted ads)
- Behavioural advertising
- Data gathering, tracking [click stream data, cookies]
- Data analysis, profiling
- Design implications, e.g. default privacy settings set to open

### Human/Robot (inter) action?
- Facebook has said it believes there are now more than 83 million illegitimate accounts on the social network.
- Duplicate profiles - belonging to already registered users - made up 4.8% of its membership figure.
- digital distribution firm Limited Press alleged that, based on its own analytics software, 80% of clicks on its advertisements within Facebook had come from fake users. In a post on its Facebook page, the company said: "Bots were loading pages and driving up our advertising costs."

Ethical Issues
- Blurring of "public" and "private" - implications for the user of social media, and often their friends and associates
Opportunities for Deception:
- Creating false accounts 
	- Good? E.g. Use of honeypots trap e.g. paedophiles (see recent case 'computer-generated child' created by Dutch agency)
	- Bad? E.g. Implications for identity (theft)
- Implications for trust, credibility, responsibility?
	- Information given in confidence?
	- Information given in the expectation of non-sharing
	- Information given to a trusted person -> relationship changes, becomes threatening
### Ethical issues for the professions
Legal profession
Example: 'Friending' someone to get access to their social media page (e.g. a lawyer on a case asking a witness to 'friend' so the lawyer can have access to the site)
Medical profession.
Example: medical students discussing patients with friends online
- It would be inappropriate to post informal, personal or derogatory comments about patients or colleagues on public internet forums
#### Privacy
Data retention (the unforgetting Internet)
Future implications of past data (e.g. images, statements)
- Right to be forgotten (EU debates)
Data sharing and third party access
- Right to give informed consent, transparency
The privacy debate
- Privacy expectations in the age of social media?
### Professional and Legal Issues
Legal obligations of SNS providers
- Data protection; security; IPR; free speech
- Liabilities and responsibilities
- Compliance with subpoenas, court orders, police requests (profile data as "evidence")
Professional issues for the IT professional
- Design (interfaces, settings, algorithms)
- Management issues (SNS at work, in education)
- Checking policies-does the SNS code of practice and related policies (re: privacy, security, data protection) meet the IT professional Codes of Conduct?
